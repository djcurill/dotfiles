# My Dev Card
**Editor of Choice:** LunarVim
I love the look, and it provides sane defaults. The documentation could be better,
but it is concise. For anyone wanting use LunarVim, I recommend working through 
[Chris@machine YoutTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctH-a-1eUME&list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ) that explains how to configure Neovim from scratch. 

**Shell of Choice:** Zsh + Oh-my-zsh + powerlevel10k

**Theme:** Tokyo Midnight
